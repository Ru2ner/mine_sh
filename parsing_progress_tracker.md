* trim_whitespaces  :x:

* word  :x:
* cmd  :x:
* cmd_with_args  :x:
* pipe  :x:
* redirections(< && >)  :x:
* redirections_append_and_here_doc(<< && >>)  :x:
* infiles_and_outfiles  :x:

# PARSER

Processes the tokens generated by the tokenizer and organizes them according to a defined order :
 - group tokens into commands with their args
 - build an AST (abstract syntax tree) for complex commands involving pipes etc...

* syntax_validation  :x:
* command_grouping  :x:
